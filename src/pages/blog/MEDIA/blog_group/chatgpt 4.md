## The Art of Basic Prompting

As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.

Hence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexityâ€”beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind â€“ aren't inputs and prompts identical?

### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt

In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.

Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as "generate a summary of this article" to a complex query like "What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?".

In essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.

Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.

Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:

## Harnessing System Messages
Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.

System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.

### What are System Messages?
Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.

In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.

For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: "You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflÃ©."

With this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.

### Why Use System Messages?
So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?

Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.

By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.

### Practical Applications of System Messages
The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.

In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.

In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like "You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.

### In Conclusion
Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.

Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!

                            The goal is important as it sets the direction for the task, and provides a clear outcome for the model to work towards. The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.

                            Adversarial Input is a powerful tool for evaluating the robustness of a model, as it allows you to test the model's ability to handle inputs that are designed to be difficult or misleading. This type of input can help identify weaknesses in the model and inform future improvements. Examples of adversarial inputs include providing a model with a text prompt that uses a lot of technical jargon, or providing a model with a list of quotes that are out of context. It is important to note that when using adversarial inputs, it is important to clearly define the parameters of the test and interpret the results with caution, as the model's performance on adversarial inputs may not necessarily reflect its performance on real-world inputs.

                        Initial inputs are important when working with chatGPT because they set the foundation for the model's output. By providing the model with a clear and well-defined starting point, we can ensure that the output is relevant and on-topic. This is particularly important when working on broad topic generation or ideation tasks, as it helps to guide the model's output and keep it focused on the desired topic. Additionally, providing a specific and clear initial input can also help to improve the performance of the model, as it allows the model to better understand the task at hand and generate more accurate and useful output.
